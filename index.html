            InDent Research was founded as an international hub to conduct high
            quality research in dental, clinical, basic and translational
            sciences with the ultimate goal to transform clinical practice and
            provide patients with the ultimate in care.
          </p>
          <p class="text-justify">
            At InDent, we have created an environment where our investigators
            conduct innovative research with an only quest for uncompromising
            excellence. As clinicians, we believe that a highly detailed,
            meticulous clinical approach based in scientific evidence and robust
            clinical studies results in the best possible outcomes for patients,
            where treatments have increased rates of success and longer-term
            stability outcomes. Therefore, our continued engagement in research
            is paramount to achieving excellence in patient care.

          <p class="text-justify">
            In order for dental practice to improve the lives of the patients,
            we wish to reduce the time and discomfort of treatments, improve the
            healing of tissues and offer easier recoveries. To do so, it is a
            high priority to be on the leading edge of modern specialized dental
            care by using the most advanced dental technology and techniques and
            to participate in new and revolutionary research studies. Fostering
            collaborations between different institutions and research groups
            becomes a key element to this aim together with education and
            communication involvement in global events.

                Edentulism, partial or full, is a common health
                issue<sup>1</sup>. Treatments range from no treatment to fixed
                partial dentures for smaller edentulous spaces and conventional
                dentures for total edentulism<sup>1</sup>. Osseointegrated
                implant supported prosthesis can be a predictable alternative,
                and have been indicated for the treatment ranging from single
                tooth edentulous spaces up to complete edentulism<sup>1</sup>.
                Current research has observed high survival rates of dental
                implants in longitudinal studies with long term follow
                ups<sup>2,3</sup>.
              </p>
              <p class="text-justify">
                Even though implant supported restorations are both esthetic and
                functional, they require the patient to have an adequate volume
                of bone, both from a quantitative and histological standpoint,
                in order to render satisfactory long term
                outcomes<sup>4,5</sup>. Implantology research aims to improve
                implant success and survival, decrease patient morbidity and
                surgical complications and reduce cost and time of the
                treatments.

                Implants treatment, chosen from immediate, early or delayed
                procedures, are often coupled with GBR therapies<sup>1</sup>.
                The basic principles of GBR were described in the late 80’s<sup
                  >2,3</sup
                >
                and predictable regeneration defects has been described with the
                use of bone graft and membrane application to provide structural
                support and sufficient access to blood supply to achieve
                regeneration<sup>4,5</sup>. Autograft, xenografts, allografts
                and their combinations using freeze dried bone from cortical and
                cancellous areas offer a great chance to clinicians<sup>6</sup>.
              </p>
              <p class="text-justify">
                In addition, vertical and horizontal regeneration can also be
                achieved with the use of reinforced membranes and metallic mesh
                support<sup>7,8</sup>. However, drawbacks such as the need for a
                membrane removal second stage surgery and compromised
                biocompatibility demand further research in the field. Due to
                their increased biocompatibility and regenerative potential,
                bioabsorbable membranes have shown promising results but still
                show limited predictability to obtain vertical
                regeneration<sup>9</sup>. One of the most difficult parts of GBR
                is the stabilization of the graft membrane complex. For this
                reason, membrane fixation screws, tacks, and periosteal biting
                sutures have been recommended<sup>10,11</sup>. These challenging
                procedures are technique sensitive and require further research
                to achieve the desired predictability.

                Implant procedures have been associated to the presence of
                peri-implant defects<sup>1</sup>. Even when ideal conditions are
                present and bone grafting has been performed, complications can
                still occur, and the subgingival portion of the implant abutment
                can be exposed, leading to a potential esthetic complication and
                gingival recession<sup>2</sup>. Gingival tissue thickness and
                peri implant tissues are necessary to conceal the underlying
                implant restorative materials and may impact marginal bone
                stability<sup>3,4</sup>.

                Soft tissue augmentation therapies offer the possibility to
                augment the facial gingival thickness (biotype conversion) and
                partially counteract the recession associated with the placement
                of implants in fresh extraction sockets<sup>5</sup>. Autogenous
                soft connective tissue grafts harvested from the palate or
                tuberosity are widely used but require an additional surgical
                donor site, often leading to increases in morbidity and patient

                volume that can be obtained as the availability of palatal
                tissue thickness can vary<sup>7</sup>. Several other techniques
                and materials, such as collagen membranes, have been proposed to
                augment buccal soft tissue volume and contour but they require

                Jaw bone defects or post-extraction edentulism lead to
                predictable changes of the alveolar bone in both the vertical
                and horizontal axes<sup>1</sup>. It is of utmost importance for
                clinicians to understand the oral remodeling dynamics to select
                the appropriate surgical techniques and to preserve the alveolar
                processes<sup>2</sup>.

                Implant success and survival of osseointegrated implants has
                been extensively documented, although most of the works refer to
                the posterior mandibular region<sup>3,4</sup>. Specifically,
                this anatomical region has been widely utilized for implant
                placement due to the absence of intra-bony significant
                structures, a high bone density that could potentially help the
                clinician achieve a high primary stability, and a more favorable
                pattern of post-extractive bone resorption as compared to
                posterior mandibular areas that will render more bone
                availability after post-extraction remodeling has
                occurred<sup>5</sup>.

                However, the anatomic nature of mandibular incisors often
                presents a limited mesiodistal/buccolingual dimension and
                therefore limited alveolar bone at the most coronal
                aspect<sup>6</sup>. The replacement of a mandibular single
                incisor remains, consequently, one of the most challenging
                procedures in implant dentistry, both from an executional and
                from an outcome-based standpoint. Therefore, it is important to
                evaluate radiographically the buccolingual dimension of
                mandibular incisors and the alveolar bone to further determine
                the feasibility of immediate implant placement in this
                anatomical area.

                Dental preparation techniques for crown restorations to obtain

                Recently, a new biologically oriented technique preparation
                (BOPT) is gaining acceptance as a procedure capable to fulfil
                the increasing aesthetic and biological demands<sup>4,5</sup>.
                Some authors have hypothesized BOPT technique so to avoid
                periodontal damage and resulting in obtaining periodontal
                regeneration instead4. BOPT relies on the triad comprised of a
                vertical tooth preparation, combined with a gingitage to
                generate a clot, which is stabilized with immediate
                provisionalization<sup>4,6</sup>. Increased periodontal
                stability is therefore achieved, inhibiting apical migration of
                the epithelium and generating a longer supracrestal connective
                tissue attachment<sup>7</sup>. BOPT can be considered as a
                regenerative periodontal treatment fulfilling the five pillars
                of regeneration, surgical preparation, space provision,
                biomodification, stability and wound closure.

                  complex bone and soft tissue regeneration and laser
                  periodontics (LANAP). Periodontists normally complete a 3-year
                  residency after dental school in order to become a
                  periodontist. Because Dr. Puterman recognized the benefits of
                  further expertise with dental implants, he also completed an
                  additional 3-year residency in Implant Dentistry. For dental

                  residency programs and a Master's Degree at California's Loma
                  Linda University. The intense dual residency training involved
                  treating the most complex case types, and included advanced
                  training in bone and soft tissue grafting, microsurgery,
                  prosthodontics, anesthesia, sedation, and the treatment of
                  various oral pathologies. He is one of a handful of
